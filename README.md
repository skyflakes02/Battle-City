BATTLE CITY GAME MECHANICS

MAIN GOAL: Win by destroying all enemy tanks on each stage.

GAME CONTROLS:
- Use your arrow or WASD keys to move
- Press the spacebar to shoot bullets

1. Enemy Tanks
- Different types of enemy tanks will spawn randomly throughout the game. 
- With only 2 lives, your task is to shoot and destroy every enemy tank to proceed to the next stage.
- Hitting an enemy tank returns it to its spawn point. Destroy each tank 3 times to win.

2. Your Tank
- An enemy tank hitting you decreases your life by 1 and returns you to your spawn point. 
- Remaining lives carry over to the next stages of the game.

3. Types of Cells
-> The Brick Cell: Shooting this turns it into a cracked brick cell. Hitting it again destroys it completely.
-> The Stone Cell: A permanent wall; shooting this does nothing.
-> The Mirror Cell: Bullets will be reflected depending on the cell's orientation.
-> The Water Cell: A permanent wall, but bullets can pass through.
-> The Forest Cell: Provides partial camouflage.
-> The Home Cell: The cell you must protect. Once destroyed, the game ends regardless of the remaining lives.
